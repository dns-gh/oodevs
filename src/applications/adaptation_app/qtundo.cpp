    \class QtCommand

    \brief The QtCommand class is the base class of all commands stored on a QtUndoStack.

    For an overview of the Qt Undo/Redo framework, see \l overview.html.

    A QtCommand represents a single editing action which an
    application can make, for example, inserting or deleting a block
    of text in a text editor. QtCommand knows how to apply a change to
    an object and how to undo the change.

    A change is applied by calling redo(). A change is undone by
    calling undo(). The default implementations of these virtual
    functions in QtCommand do nothing, they must be overriden in a
    derived class.

    \code
    CmdChangeImage::CmdChangeImage(Face *face, const QString &image)
    {
    m_face = face;
    m_old_image = face->image();
    m_new_image = image;
    setCanMerge(false);
    setDescription(tr("change %1 to %2").arg(m_old_image).arg(m_new_image));
    }

    void CmdChangeImage::redo()
    {
    m_face->setImage(m_new_image);
    }

    void CmdChangeImage::undo()
    {
    m_face->setImage(m_old_image);
    }
    \endcode

    A QtCommand object has a type(), which is used to differentiate
    between ordinary commands and macro delimiters. An ordinary
    command is of type() \c Command. A macro delimiter's type() is
    either \c MacroBegin or \c MacroEnd. Sequences of commands between
    macro delimiters are undone and redone in one go, rather than one
    at a time.

    Each QtCommand has a merge flag, returned by canMerge().
    QtUndoStack::push() will attempt to merge a new command with the
    current command in the stack only if they are both instances of
    the same class (ascertained using QObject::className()) \e and if
    the new command's merge flag is true.

    A QtCommand object has a description(), which describes its effect
    on the edited object. This description is used to assign
    meaningful information to the widgets which trigger undo or
    redo in an application, such as the QAction objects returned by
    QtUndoManager::createUndoAction() and QtUndoManager::createRedoAction().

    \warning All classes derived from QtCommand must contain the
    Q_OBJECT macro in their declaration.

/*!
    \class QtUndoStack

    \brief The QtUndoStack class is a stack of QtCommand objects.

    For an overview of the Qt Undo/Redo framework, see \l overview.html.

    New commands are added with push(). When a command is pushed on to
    the stack, QtUndoStack takes ownership of the command and applies
    it by calling QtCommand::redo(). Undo and redo are invoked with
    undo() and redo(). These functions may be called directly, or
    through the QtUndoManager::undoAction() and
    QtUndoManager::redoAction() QAction objects. In the latter case,
    QtUndoManager will choose a stack based on which object has the
    focus, and call the relevant undo() or redo() function.

    \code
    FaceEdit::FaceEdit(QWidget *parent, const char *name)
    : QWidget(parent, name, Qt::WDestructiveClose)
    {
    ...
    m_undo_stack = new QtUndoStack(this);
    ...
    }

    void FaceEdit::setImage(const QString &image_name)
    {
    Face *face = focusedFace();
    ...
    m_undo_stack->push(new CmdChangeImage(face, image_name));
    ...
    }
    \endcode

    QtUndoStack supports command compression. This is useful when
    several commands can be compressed into a single command, which
    can be undone and redone in one go. An example of this is a text
    editor. When the user types in a character, a new action is
    created, which inserts that character into the document at the
    cursor position. However, it is more convenient for the user to be
    able to undo or redo typing in whole words, sentences and
    paragraphs. Command compression allows these single-character
    commands to be merged into a single command which inserts or
    deletes chunks of text. See push() for more information on
    command compression.

    QtUndoStack supports command macros. A command macro is a sequence
    of commands which are undone and redone in one go. The sequence
    starts with a QtCommand object whose \link QtCommand::type()
    type()\endlink is \link QtCommand::MacroBegin MacroBegin\endlink.
    The \link QtCommand::description() description()\endlink of this
    command is taken to describe the effect of the entire macro. The
    sequence ends with a QtCommand object whose \link
    QtCommand::type() type()\endlink is
    \link QtCommand::MacroEnd MacroEnd\endlink. See undo() and redo()
    for more information on command macros.

    \code
    void FaceEdit::clearFaces()
    {
    ...
    m_undo_stack->push(new QtCommand(QtCommand::MacroBegin, "Clear faces"));
    for (; *child_it != 0; ++child_it) {
        Face *face = (Face*) *child_it;
        m_undo_stack->push(new CmdChangeImage(face, "none"));
        m_undo_stack->push(new CmdChangeColor(face, "green"));
    }
    m_undo_stack->push(new QtCommand(QtCommand::MacroEnd));
    ...
    }
    \endcode

    A certain state of the edited object may be marked as "clean", using
    setClean(). This function is usually called whenever the edited object
    is saved.  QtUndoStack emits the cleanChanged() signal whenever
    the edited object enters or leaves the clean state.

/*!
    \class QtUndoManager

    \brief The QtUndoManager class manages command stacks in an
    undo/redo framework based on the Command design pattern.

    For an overview of the Qt Undo/Redo framework, see \l overview.html.

    QtUndoManager keeps a list of QtUndoStack objects. Each is a list
    of QtCommand objects and a pointer to the last executed command
    (the undo stack's \e current command). Undo is invoked by calling
    the current command's QtCommand::undo() function and making the
    previous command in the stack the current command. Redo is invoked
    by making the next command in the stack the current command and
    calling its QtCommand::redo() function.

    An application has one global QtUndoManager, accessed through the
    static function QtUndoManager::manager() (which creates the
    QtUndoManager when it is called for the first time).

    Undo and redo are requested through the undo() and redo() slots.
    QtUndoManager also provides the functions createUndoAction()
    and createRedoAction() for creating QAction objects that trigger
    undo and redo. These QActions have the additional benefit of keeping
    their text properties in sync with undoDescription() and redoDescription(),
    as well as disabling themselves whenever no commands are available
    for undo or redo.

    \code
    MainWindow::MainWindow(QWidget *parent, const char *name)
    : QMainWindow(parent, name)
    {
    ...
    QtUndoManager *manager = QtUndoManager::manager();
    QAction *undo_action = manager->createUndoAction(this);
    QAction *redo_action = manager->createRedoAction(this);
    undo_action->setAccel(QKeySequence("Ctrl+Z"));
    redo_action->setAccel(QKeySequence("Shift+Ctrl+Z"));

    QToolBar *toolbar = new QToolBar(this);
    undo_action->addTo(toolbar);
    redo_action->addTo(toolbar);

    QPopupMenu *editmenu = new QPopupMenu(this);
    undo_action->addTo(editmenu);
    redo_action->addTo(editmenu);
    ...
    }
    \endcode

    A single application can have multiple undo stacks, typically one
    for each editor window in an MDI application. Each stack is
    associated with a widget, called the stack's \e target. undo() and
    redo() requests are directed to a stack whenever its target, or a
    child of its target, has the keyboard focus. A target is associated
    with a stack in QtUndoStack's constructor. Additional targets may be
    associated with a stack using associateView(). This is useful when
    two or more editor windows edit the same underlying object. An SDI
    aplication typically has a single stack associated with the
    application's main window.

    Whenever the widget with the keyboard focus has no targets in its
    parent chain, the QAction objects created using createUndoAction() and
    createRedoAction() are disabled.
