<h2>Context</h2>
</td><td><i>Riots typically involve vandalism and the destruction of private and public property. The specific property to be targeted varies depending on the riot and the inclinations of those involved. Targets can include shops, cars, restaurants, state-owned institutions, and religious buildings.</i>
<br>In SWORD, to use crowds agent in order to make the structural state of installations (urban blocks or objects) decreases with a given quantity (% of current structural state). <br>

<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>The agent moves toward the objective, following a computed route. If an obstacle is encountered on the way to the objective, the crowd stops and a new temporary concentration is created. The movement is suspended until the obstacle is removed. <br>
</li>
<li>The agent's attitude is automatically set to "agressive" but it can be changed at any time by user (by issuing the "change attitude" order).<br>
</li>
<li>Once the head of the crowd reaches the objective (once the crowd takes contact with the objective),  the agent starts to damage it (the report "critical site under attack" is displayed).<br>

<h2>Comments</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>For urban blocks, the delays and efficiency of the "damage" action depends on the crowd capabilities (see authoring tool, "Crowds" then "urban area destruction" section). <br>
</li>
<li>For other Sword object, the construction level is decreased with the issued quantity. It is independent of the agent physical capabilities.  A damaged object may disappear if it is entirely destroyed.<br>
