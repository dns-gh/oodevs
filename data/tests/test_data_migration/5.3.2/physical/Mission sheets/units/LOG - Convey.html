<h2>Behavior</h2>

<ul>
<li>The visible behavior that is performed by the agent is described as follows:<br>
</li>
<ul>
<li>the agent waits for its vehicle to be set up (another agent provides vehicles to create the convoy). The report "convoy is being prepared" is displayed.<br>
</li>
<li>Then, the agent moves to the supplier, and loads supplies (the reports "moving to supplier" and then "convoy: loading" are displayed).<br>
</li>
<li>Once it has finished, it moves to the recipient and unloads supplies (the reports "moving toward unloading point" and then "convoy: unloading" are displayed).<br>
</li>
<li>It then moves to the vehicle provider (the agent that set up the convoy) and the mission ends and terminates.<br>

<h2>Specific cases</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>In case of pushed flux, it possible for the convey to move and suplliy several recipients. In that case, the agent moves to the first one, unloads supplies, then moves to the second one and so on...<br>

<h2>Comments</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>When the mission terminates, the created convoy "disappears" from the orbat (the vehicles return inside provider, and the convoy no longer exists). <br>
</li>
<li>The user can terminate the mission by issuing another mission or a fragmentary order. The user can then reissue the mission (by left-clicking on the unit) and the agent will be able to continue the resupply action.<br>
</li>
<li>For more information about the stages of the supply actions, you can open the the supply system window (see screenshot). From here you will be able to follow the processing consigns (by double-clicking on each consign).<br>
