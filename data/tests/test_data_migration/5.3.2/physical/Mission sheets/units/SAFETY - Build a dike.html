<h2>Context</h2>
</td><td><i>To construct a dike to protect sites from floods.</i>
<br>In SWORD, to create and build an object that may prevent areas or sites from floods. As the flood can't cover an area whose altitude is too high, the constructed dike must be built with sufficient height.<br>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
</td><td>
<h2>Mandatory</h2>
<h3>Danger direction</h3>Expected enemy direction.<br>
<h3>Dike location</h3>The work location for the dike. <br>
<h2>Optional</h2>
<h3>Phase lines</h3>Lines used by units to adapt their behavior when they reach or cross them.<br>
<h3>Limit 1</h3>Right or left boundaries inside which the agent performs the mission.<br>
<h3>Limit 2</h3>Right or left boundaries inside which the agent performs the mission.<br>

<td width="200">
<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>The agent moves toward a construction position to create the dike. The position to create the dike is automatically determinated by the agent (on the edge of the work location).<br>Upon reaching the construction position, the agent starts to create and construct the dike (the "work just started" report should be displayed). Upon construction termination (the report "work completed for object [object name]" is displayed) the mission ends.<br>

<tr>
<td width="200">
<h2>Specific cases</h2>
</td><td>The dike may not be created. Possible causes are:<br>
<ul>
<li>the agent doesn't have the physical capability or it hasn't enough resources.<br>
</li>
<li>the dike object definition is wrong (the object capacity "construction" for the 'dike' object is not set in the authoring tool).<br>
</li>
</ul>If this case, the report 'Impossible work' is displayed, and the mission ends.<br>
