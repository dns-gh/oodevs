<h2>Context</h2>
</td><td><i>To move to an underground entrance and close it...</i>
<br>In Sword, to reach an 'underground exit' object and deactivate it in order to prevent agents of simulation from using it (the agents won't be able to enter or exit the underground network  using the supplied exit object).<br>

<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>The agent moves toward the given underground exit. If it is not reachable (the object is located inside an urban block within which the agent cannot move), the agent moves as close as possible. Average speed depends on the physical capabilities, taking into account terrain properties.<br>
</li>
<li>Upon reaching the underground exit, the agent simply deactivates it. The report "the underground exit has been deactivated" is displayed. The object status should switch from "activated: Yes" to "Activated: No" (see screenshot below).<br>
</li>
<li>Upon action termination, the agent moves to the meeting position.<br>
</li>
</ul>
