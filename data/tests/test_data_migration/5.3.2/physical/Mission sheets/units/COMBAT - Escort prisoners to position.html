<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>The agent moves toward each given surrendered unit, from the nearest to the furthest. If a surrendered unit position is not reachable (the unit is located inside an urban block inside which the agent cannot move, for instance), the agent moves as close as possible. Average speed depends on the physical capabilities regarding the terrain properties.<br>
</li>
<li>Upon reaching a surrendered unit, the agent loads it ("magic/irrealistic" transportation).<br>
</li>
<li>Once all units have been loaded, they are transported to the given location.<br>
</li>
<li>Upon reaching the given position, all transported units are unloaded.<br>
