<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>The agent moves toward the issued target. If it is not reachable (an urban block inside which the agent cannot move, for instance), the agent moves as close as possible, else it moves directly to the position. Average speed depends on physical capabilities with respect to terrain properties.<br>Upon reaching the target, the agent acts to kill the officer components of the unit (the report "attack is being executed" is displayed).<br>Then, it moves to the meeting position and the missions ends.<br>Note that the mission functions in the same way if the target unit has no officiers.<br>If this mission is carried out by a "terrorist" agent, it may not be possible to detect it unless the target unit is defended by safety devices such as check points.<br>
