<h2>Context</h2>
</td><td>To operate an NBC decontamination site in order to ensure unit decontamination.<br>In SWORD, to build and operate a decontamination site object. Operating a decontamination site allows the agent to complete decontamination missions using that site. It decontaminates contaminated units (contaminated units may be issued the "Get decontaminated" mission).<br>

<h2>Parameters</h2>

<h2>Mandatory</h2>
<h3>Danger direction</h3>Expected enemy direction.<br>
<h3>Planned site</h3>The decontamination site object to be operated.<br>
<h2>Optional</h2>
<h3>Phase lines</h3>Lines used by units to adapt their behavior when they reach or cross them.<br>
<h3>Limit 1</h3>Right or left boundaries inside which the agent performs the mission.<br>
<h3>Limit 2</h3>Right or left boundaries inside which the agent performs the mission.<br>

<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>The agent moves toward the planned work to build (to build the object, the agent automatically determines a position on the border of the planned object). If the position is not reachable, the agent moves as close as possible. <br>
</li>
<li>Upon reaching the work position the agent starts to build the object.<br>
</li>
<li>Once the decontamination site has been built, the agent moves to the center of the object and starts to operate it (the report "Element is being operated" should be displayed).<br>

<h2>Comments</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>The decontamination site may not be created if the agent does not have the capacity to build it in terms of physical capability and dotations. In this specific case, the report "work impossible, no capacity" is displayed and the mission ends.<br>
</li>
<li>The decontamination site may not be operated if it simply cannot be operated (see object capacity "workable" in authoring tool). In this case, the report "element cannot be operated" is displayed and the mission ends.<br>
</li>
<li>Note that no specific capabilities are required for the agent to operate a decontamination site.<br>
</li>
<li>The agent cannot be contaminated by other units while operating a decontamination site.<br>
