  <behavior>
    <line>
      <text>The agent moves toward each work to construct. The order of the elements into the 'Works' list defines the order of visit. The positions reached to construct each object are automatically determinated by the agent.</text>
    </line>
    <line>
      <text>Upon reaching a construction position, the agent starts to construct the object (the "work just started" report should be displayed). Upon construction termination (the report "work completed for object[object name]" should be displayed), the agent moves to the next work to do (next construction position for the next objet to construct).</text>
    </line>
  </behavior>
  <specific-cases>
    <line>
      <text>If the parameter "Instantaneously" is set to TRUE, the agents creates and builds each issued work magically. In that specific case, the object construction do not depends on the agent's physical capabilities or the object definition.</text>
    </line>
    <line>
      <text>A work may not be constructed. If the agent doesn't have the physical capability or if it hasn't enough resources to do it. In that specific case, the agent behaves in two ways depending on the 'waitForReinforcement" parameter:</text>
    </line>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <line>
          <text>if it is set to FALSE, the report 'Impossible work' is displayed, and the agent moves to the next work to construct;</text>
        </line>
      </li>
      <li>
        <line>
          <text>if it is set to TRUE, the agent will stay nearby the object and ask for reinforcement. It won't move to the next work until it is totally constructed.</text>
        </line>
      </li>
    </ul>
