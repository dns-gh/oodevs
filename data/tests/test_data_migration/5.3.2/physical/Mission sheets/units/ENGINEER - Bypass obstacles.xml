          <text>Upon reaching an obstacle, the agent starts to remove mines if the obstacle is improved by them (the report "demining the object [object name]" should be displayed). Then, three possibilities:</text>

If the obstacle cannot be removed either (if the agent doesn't have the physical capability or it hasn't enough resources to do it), the report 'Impossible work' is displayed. In this case the agent waits to be reinforced.</text>
