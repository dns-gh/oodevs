<h2>Context</h2>
</td><td><i>A mission undertaken to obtain information by visual observation, or other detection methods, about the activities and resources of an enemy, or about the meteorological, hydrographic, or geographic characteristics of a particular area.</i>
<br>For NBC reconnaisssance units, to predict and warn of hazard areas from NBC attacks and from ROTA (release other than attack). It allows evaluation of NBC information and the influence of NBC incidents on operations.<i></i>
<br>In Sword, to reach a set of ordered objectives (position, area, urban blocks, object) in order to search for specific objects (such as mines and various obstacles) by activating a specific "reconnaissance" action. NBC agents of the simulation are able to reconnoiter objects, specific locations, areas and urban blocks. The time required for reconnaissance depends on the type of the objective to reconnoiter. The bigger the objective is, the more time the reconnaissance takes.<br>

<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>The agent protects itself with NBC protection and then moves toward each of the objectives following the order of the elements in the list.  If one of them is not reachable (an urban block inside which the agent cannot move, for instance), the agent moves as close as possible, otherwise it moves to the center of the position. Average speed depends on the physical capabilities with regard to terrain properties. <br>
</li>
<li>Upon reaching an objective, the agent starts the reconnaissance (the report "Position reconnaissance started" should be displayed). After a delay depending on the size of the objective, the reconnaissance ends (the report "Position reconnaissance completed" should be displayed), and the agent starts to move to the next objective.<br>
</li>
<li>Once all the objectives has been reconnoitered, the agent stays at its last position and the mission ends.<br>
