<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>The agent moves toward each crowd. The order of the elements in the 'Crowds' list defines the order of visits.<br>Upon reaching a crowd (the agent moves to the center of the crowd's concentration),  if it contains victims (wounded humans), the agent acts to extract victims from it (the report "starting to extract victims" is displayed). Once it is done (the report "victims extracted" should be displayed), a new crowd is created next to the initial crowd (with all wounded humans from the initial Crowd). Note that the position of the newly created crowd is randomly determined on the edge of the initial crowd. In consequence, the initial crowd no longer contains wounded humans.<br>The time taken for extraction does not depend on crowd size or the number of victims. Extracting victims takes a few minutes (defined in decisional models).<br>
