          <text>Note that the agent chooses an aircraft among those that are available to be operated. The corresponding aircrafts are the those that have not been already operated, or the those that are not already performing a mission. If the agent cannot operate an aircraft, the report "no aircraft available" is displayed. In that case the mission terminates.</text>
