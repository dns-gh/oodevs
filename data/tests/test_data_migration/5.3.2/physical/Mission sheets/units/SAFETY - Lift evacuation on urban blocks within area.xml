      <text>In SWORD, a population is evacuated from the urban block it populates. This mission is the reverse of the "Lift evacuation from urban blocks within area" mission. Its goal is to lift an evacuation on a set of urban blocks within a specified zone.</text>

  <behavior>
    <line>
      <text>The agent moves toward each urban block which is totally inside the specified area (the order of traversal is defined randomly). The agent stops at the border of the urban block.</text>
    </line>
    <line>
      <text>Upon reaching an urban block, the agent lifts evacuation on it before moving to the next unvisited urban block.</text>
    </line>
  </behavior>
  <specific-cases>
    <line>
      <text>The evacuation status may not be lifted if the urban block cannot be populated (the report "urban block cannot be inhabited" is displayed) . In this case, the agent decides to act on the block.</text>

    <line>
      <text>When there are no more urban blocks to visit, the agent stays next to the last visited block and the mission ends.</text>

      <text>If there are no urban blocks within the area, the mission ends and the report "no urban blocks within area" is displayed.</text>
