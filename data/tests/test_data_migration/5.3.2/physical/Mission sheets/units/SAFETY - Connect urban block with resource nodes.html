<h2>Context</h2>
</td><td>In SWORD, connecting urban blocks with resources nodes allows an agent to create links from a distributing urban block to one or more receiving urban blocks for a given resource.<br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="200">
<h2>Parameters</h2>
</td><td>
<h2>Mandatory</h2>
<h3>Danger direction</h3>Expected enemy direction.<br>
<h3>Urban block (producer)</h3>The producer of the resource network to establish.<br>
<h3>Resource nodes (receivers)</h3>The list of the receivers of the resource network to establish, each item defined by a resource and the support of the node (object or urban block). <br>
<h2>Optional</h2>
<h3>Phase lines</h3>Lines used by units to adapt their behavior when they reach or cross them.<br>
<h3>Limit 1</h3>Right or left boundaries inside which the agent performs the mission.<br>
<h3>Limit 2</h3>Right or left boundaries inside which the agent performs the mission.<br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="200">
<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>The agent moves toward each receivers in the order given by the operator. When the agent reaches a receiver, it establishes a resource network link from the producer to this receiver.<br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="200">
<h2>Specific cases</h2>
</td><td>If the traficability of one of the receiving urban blocks is too low for the agent, it will report "Cannot reach objective" and skip the connection for this resource node.<br>
