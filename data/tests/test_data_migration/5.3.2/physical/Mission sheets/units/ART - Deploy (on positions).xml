      <text>In SWORD, to know how to move toward a deployment position (an object knowledge built by specific units or designated terrain location) and self deploy onto it. Once the agent gets deployed, it is ready to apply indirect fire (see fragmentary order "fire"). If a set of positions is issued, the agent can change its position after each fire execution.</text>

      <text>If the deployment positions are not issued the agent deploys on its own position. </text>
    </line>
    <line>
      <text>If positions are issued, the agent randomly chooses a position, moves toward it and self deploys onto it (the report "starting to deploy" then "section deployed" should be displayed). The deployment may take some time (see "deployment" section on "units" tab).</text>
    </line>
    <line>
      <text>Upon deployment termination, the agent is ready to receive the fragmentary order "FIRE" to apply indirect fire (the report "ready to fire" is displayed).</text>
    </line>
    <line>
      <text>Upon receiving the order to fire, the reports "Fire fragmentary order received" and "fire request received" are displayed and the agent launches the selected projectile. </text>
    </line>
    <line>
      <text>If it cannot be possible (the agent has no more ammo for instance), the report "no ammo" is displayed.</text>
    </line>
    <line>
      <text>In all cases, if the Change position automatically parameter is set to 'TRUE' (default value), the agent moves to a next position to avoid counter battery</text>
