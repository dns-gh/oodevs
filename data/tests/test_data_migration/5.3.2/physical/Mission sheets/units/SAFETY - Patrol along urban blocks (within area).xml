          <text>The agent moves toward each urban block which is totally inside the specified area (the order of traversal is randomly defined). If a visited urban block is not reachable, the agent moves as close as possible (the agents can move within it), the agent moves to the center, else it moves to a close position (the closest position from the center).</text>

          <text>Upon reaching a urban block, the agent get posted on its position (the report "deployment in progress" is displayed). Once it is done, the agent displays the report "installation completed" and moves to the next one.</text>
