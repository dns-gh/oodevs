<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>The agent moves toward each objective to dismantle.  It acts on each objective by following the order of the elements in the 'Objectives' list. The position to remove each objective is automatically determined by the agent.<br>
</li>
<li>If an object is improved with mines, the agent needs to remove mines before starting to deconstruct it.<br>
</li>
<li>Upon reaching an objective, the agent starts to remove it (the report "work just started"  should be displayed). Upon work termination (the report "work completed for object [object name]" is displayed) the agent goes to the next objective.<br>
</li>
<li>An object may not be removed if the agent doesn't have the physical capability or it hasn't enough resources. In this case, the report 'Impossible work' is displayed, and the mission ends. In this case the agent waits to be reinforced.<br>
</li>
<li>If needed, the agent dismounts to remove the object.<br>
</li>
<li>When all objects have been visited, the agent moves to the meeting position.<br>

<h2>Specific cases</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>If the "wait for reinforcement" parameter is set to "true" (default vlaue is 'FALSE') the agent waits for reinforcement before visiting the next objective.<br>
</li>
<li>At any times, the user can order the agent to visit the next objective by issuing the <b>"Go to next objective</b>" fragmentary order . If this order is issued when the agent is working on the last objective, the agent moves to the meeting position.<br>
