          <text>The agent follows friendly units (it follows the nearest unit) at a minimum distance (100 meters). If a chosen following position is not reachable (a followed agent stays in an urban block inside which the agent cannot move, for instance), the agent moves as close as possible (the agent may stay at a distance greater than 100 meters). Average speed depends on the physical capabilities with respect to terrain properties.</text>
