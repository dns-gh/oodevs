<h2>Context</h2>
</td><td><i>To depollute or decontaminate in order to rehabilitate a site or a soil that has been polluted by industrial activities. The decontamination of a site reduces the risk of pollution to acceptable levels or make it disappear.</i>
<br>In SWORD, decontaminating a site ("contaminated site") by NBC unit prevents units from being contaminated. It prevents the creation and the dispersion of a contaminated cloud that can cause injuries in units. A "decontaminated site" in SWORD is defined by a surface delimited by a polygon. All contamination objects (such as "contaminated area") that intersect with the decontaminated surface lose their contamination capacity.<br>
