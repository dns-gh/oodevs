<h2>Context</h2>
</td><td><i>To depollute or decontaminate in order to rehabilitate a site or a soil that has been polluted by industrial activities. The decontamination of a site reduces the risk of pollution to acceptable levels or make it disappear.</i>
<br>In SWORD, decontaminating a site ("contaminated site") prevents units from being contaminated. It prevents the creation and the dispersion of a contaminated cloud that can cause injuries in units. A "decontaminated site" in SWORD is defined by a surface delimited by a polygon. All contamination objects (such as "contaminated area") that intersect with the decontaminated surface lose their contamination capacity.<br>

<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>The agent moves toward each element to decontaminate (an area or a urban block) (the order of traversal is defined by user). If a visited element is reachable (the agents can enter it), the agent moves to the center, otherwise it moves to a close position (the position closest to the center).<br>Upon reaching an element (an area or an urban block), the agent decontaminates it before moving to the next unvisited element.<br>
