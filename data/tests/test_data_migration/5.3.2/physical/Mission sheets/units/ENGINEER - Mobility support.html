<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>The agent follows friendly units (it follows the nearest unit) at a minimum distance (100 meters). If a chosen following position is not reachable (a followed agent stays in an urban block inside which the agent cannot move, for instance), the agent moves as close as possible (the agent may stay at a distance greater than 100 meters). Average speed depends on the physical capabilities with respect to terrain properties.<br>
</li>
<li>Upon reaching a supporting position, the agent is ready to intervene.<br>
</li>
<li>If followed units encounter obstacles on their computed path, they ask the agent to intevene. In this case, the agent moves to the obstacles and removes them. The first obstacle to be removed is the one that is the nearest to the unit.<br>
</li>
<li>If the supported unit can avoid the encountered obstacle by itself, a new path is computed and the unit continues on to the next waypoint using the new route, while the agent removes the obstacle.<br>
