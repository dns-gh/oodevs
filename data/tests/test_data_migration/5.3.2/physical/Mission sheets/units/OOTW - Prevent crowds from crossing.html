<ul>
<li>The agent moves to the work location and creates (magically) a checkpoint (the report "control point established" should be displayed)<br>
</li>
<li>The agent then moves to the center of the checkpoint in order to operate it (the report "element [object name] is being operated should be displayed).<br>

<h2>Specific cases</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li> If the work location is not reachable, the agent moves as close as possible, otherwise it moves to a close position (the closest position from the center of the future object) and the agent builds the object. In this case, it is possible that the object will not be built at the exact location.<br>
</li>
<li>If encountered crowds cannot be controlled (see specific reports) the checkpoint may be destroyed and the agent may protect itself by moving to the given safety position:<br>
</li>
</ul>1) The agent tries to deny the crowd from crossing the crossroad:<br>

<li>encountered crowds can be kept under control. In this case the agent remains at the checkpoint until mission termination.<br>
