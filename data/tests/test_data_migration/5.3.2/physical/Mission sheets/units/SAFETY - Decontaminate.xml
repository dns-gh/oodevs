      <text>In SWORD, decontaminating a site ("contaminated site") prevents units from being contaminated. It prevents the creation and the dispersion of a contaminated cloud that can cause injuries in units. A "decontaminated site" in SWORD is defined by a surface delimited by a polygon. All contamination objects (such as "contaminated area") that intersect with the decontaminated surface lose their contamination capacity.</text>

    <line>
      <text>The agent moves toward each element to decontaminate (an area or a urban block) (the order of traversal is defined by user). If a visited element is reachable (the agents can enter it), the agent moves to the center, otherwise it moves to a close position (the position closest to the center).</text>
    </line>
    <line>
      <text>Upon reaching an element (an area or an urban block), the agent decontaminates it before moving to the next unvisited element.</text>
