<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>The agent moves toward a construction position to create the roadblock. The position to create the roadblock is automatically determined by the agent (on the edge of the work location).<br>Upon reaching the construction position, the agent starts to create and construct the roadblock (the report "work just started" should be displayed). Upon construction termination (the report "work completed for object [object name]" is displayed).<br>The roadblock is removed at the end of mission by default if optional parameter is set to 'False' the roadblock is not removed<br>

<td width="200">
<h2>Specific cases</h2>
</td><td>The roadblock may not be created. Possible causes are:<br>
<ul>
<li>the agent doesn't have the physical capability.<br>
</li>
<li>the roadblock object definition is wrong (the object capacity "construction" for the 'roadblock' object is not set in the authoring tool).<br>
</li>
</ul>If this case, the report 'Impossible work' is displayed, and the mission ends.<br>
