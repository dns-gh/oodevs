<ul>
<li>The agent moves toward the first objective. If it is not reachable (an urban block inside which the agent cannot move, for instance), the agent moves as close as possible, else it moves to the center of the objective. Average speed depends on the physical capabilities and terrain properties.<br>
</li>
<li>While moving toward the objective, the agent engages all enemies within the provided area it can.<br>
</li>
