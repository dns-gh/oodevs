<ul>
<li>The agent moves to the nearest crowd.<br>
</li>
<li>Upon reaching the chosen crowd, it tries to control it. Then there are two possibilities:<br>
</li>
<ul>
<li>The crowd is under control and the agent stays next to the crowd (until it is located in the area)<br>
</li>
<li>The agent fails to control the crowd and moves to the next one.<br>

<h2>Specific cases</h2>
</td><td>If no crowd is known in the given area, the agent moves to the center of it (this is the default behavior of this task). If new crowds enter in the area, the agent will try to control each new crowd.<br>

<ul>
<li>The agent cannot control several crowds at the same time. For all known crowds in the area, the agent tries to control the nearest by moving to it. If the control fails, the agent moves to the next one and tries again. If no there is no crowd in the area, or if the agents fail to control all the known crowds, it moves to the center waiting for new crowds to enter.<br>
