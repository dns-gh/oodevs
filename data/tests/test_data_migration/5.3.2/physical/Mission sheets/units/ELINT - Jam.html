<h2>Context</h2>

<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>The agent deploys to its own position. The time required for deployment depends on the data defined in the authoring tool (see "Units" tab, "Deployment" section).  Upon deployment termination the report  "section deployed" should be displayed.<br>
</li>
<li>Upon deployment termination, the agent activates the jamming by creating a "jamming area" object.<br>

<h2>Specific cases</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>If the "disengage" order is issued, the agent moves to the meeting position (the jamming object is destroyed) and the mission ends.<br>
</li>
<li>If the "End mission" order is issued, the agent simply ends the mission (the jamming object is destroyed).<br>
