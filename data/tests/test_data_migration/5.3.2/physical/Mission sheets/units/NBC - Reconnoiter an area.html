<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>The agent self-protects with NBC protection and then moves toward the center of the area.  If it is not reachable (the center is located in an urban block the agent cannot enter, for instance), the agent moves as close as possible, otherwise it moves to the center of the position. Average speed depends on the physical capabilities with regard to terrain properties. <br>
</li>
<li>Upon reaching the center of the area, the agent starts the reconnaissance (the report "reconnaissance started" should be displayed). After a period of time depending on the size of the area, the reconnaissance ends (the report "reconnaissance completed" should be displayed), and the mission terminates.<br>
