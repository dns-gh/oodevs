<h2>Context</h2>
</td><td><i>To move inside an underground network such as a sewer, metro...</i>
<br>In Sword moving through a given underground network, the agent goes from one underground network gateway (a sword knowledge object) to another using a time period. Once the period is over, the agent teleports itself to the exit gateway. In this mission, the agent doesn't exit from the underground.<br>

<ul>
<li>While moving through the network, a report informing the user how much time the movement will take is displayed ("arrival in 20minute(s)" for instance). A specific drawing is also displayed on the agent's symbol (see screenshot below).<br>

<li>Upon delay termination, the agent is automatically teleported onto the Underground exit object, gets outside and then moves (normal movement) to the final objective.<br>
