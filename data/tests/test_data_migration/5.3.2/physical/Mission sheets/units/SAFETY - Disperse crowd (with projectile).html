<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>The agent will try to launch the specified quantity of projectiles at the given crowd, from the issued position. If a position is not issued (default value), the agent moves toward the center of the crowd until it is at a good distance to launch the given projectile (the launching distance is defined by the distance between the agent's position and the center of the target crowd).<br>Upon reaching the position, the agent launches the projectile at the crowd. The mission then ends.<br>
