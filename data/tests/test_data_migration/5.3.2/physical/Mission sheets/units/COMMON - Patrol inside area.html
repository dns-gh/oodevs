<h2>Context</h2>
</td><td><i>Patrols are missions to gather information or to control rescue operations. Patrolling could ensure law, order and check crime in a given district.</i>
<br>In SWORD, patrolling consists of moving along a path defined by waypoints, indefinitely, allowing the agent to gather information. Here, waypoints are automatically found inside the given area.<br>

<h2>Behavior</h2>

<ul>
<li>The agent moves toward each waypoint. The order of visit is randomly defined. If a visited waypoint is not reachable, the agent moves as close as possible (the agents can move within it), the agent moves to the center, otherwise it moves to a close position (the closest position to the center).<br>
</li>
<li>Upon reaching the last waypoint, the agent moves back to the first oneencountered and starts again.<br>
