      <text>In SWORD, decontaminating a site ("contaminated site") by NBC unit prevents units from being contaminated. It prevents the creation and the dispersion of a contaminated cloud that can cause injuries in units. A "decontaminated site" in SWORD is defined by a surface delimited by a polygon. All contamination objects (such as "contaminated area") that intersect with the decontaminated surface lose their contamination capacity.</text>
