<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>The agent reaches a position (selected automatically by the agent among the given positions) to observe the area. The agent will therefore observe this objective so that it will engage the enemies: any identified enemy that passes inside the area will, if possible, be destroyed. Every time the agent fires, it will move to a  previously unoccupied position, until all the positions have been occupied. The agent then starts over from the first position, or ends his mission by going to the meeting position, depending on the value of the boolean "Permanent" (by default, the agent will go the meeting position).<br>
