<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>The agent visits each crowd in the list (it moves to the center of the crowd concentrations). The order of the elements into the 'Crowds' list defines the order of visits.<br>Upon reaching a crowd, if it contains victims (wounded humans), the agent acts to heal it (the report "Starting to heal the crowd" is displayed). Once it is done (the report "wounded persons healed" should be displayed). As a consequence, the healed crowd no longer contains wounded humans.<br>The time required for healing does not depend on crowd size or the number of victims. Healing victims takes a few minutes (defined in decisional models).<br>
