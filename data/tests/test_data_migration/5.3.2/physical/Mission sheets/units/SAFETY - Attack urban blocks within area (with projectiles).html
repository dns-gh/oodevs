<h2>Context</h2>
</td><td><i>To perform a terrorist attack, exactions against installations and population.</i>
<br>In SWORD, units and crowds can assault urban blocks (or other units and structures). Assaulting an urban block causes damage to its structure and the population within. Attacking urban blocks can be used to highlight a failure in a safety device that should have been set up.<br>In this mission, the agent damages urban blocks with projectiles (indirect fire).<br>

<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>The agent tries to launch the specified quantity of projectiles on each urban block within the area, one by one. It moves toward each urban block which is totally inside the specified area (the order of traversal is randomly defined) until it is at a good distance to launch the projectile (the firing distance is defined by the distance between the agent's position and the center of each target urban block). Once the agent is able to launch the projectile on the current visited urban block, it launches the projectile on it, and will be neutralized for a short time (hiding from the explosion). Once the agent has recovered, it decides to act on the next one.<br>

<h2>Specific cases</h2>
</td><td>It is possible that the agent cannot launch the projectile on a target urban block.The causes could be:<br>
<ul>
<li>the agent doesn't have the physical capability (no suitable launcher with regard to dotation type): the report "No launcher with capacity to use specified munition" is displayed.<br>
</li>
<li>the agent does not have enough dotation: the report "no more shells" is displayed.<br>
</li>
<li>the selected resource type cannot allow the agent to perform indirect fire: the report "Impossible indirect fire" is displayed.<br>

<h2>End of mission</h2>
</td><td>The mission ends when the agent has tried to launch projectiles on each urban block.<br>If there are no urban blocks within the area, the mission ends and the report "no urban blocks within area" is displayed.<br>
