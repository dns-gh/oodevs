          <text>Upon reconnaissance termination, the agent moves toward each obstacle to bypass (beware, all objects may not be considered as 'obstacles').  Note that order of visit is randomly determined. The position to bypass each obstacle is automatically  determinated by the agent. If an obstacle is improved with mines, the agent needs to remove mines before starting to bypass it (this makes for more delays).</text>

          <text>Upon reaching an obstacle, the agent starts to bypass it (the report "work just started"  should be displayed). Upon work termination (the report "work completed for object [object name]" is displayed) the agent goes to the next obstacle.</text>

          <text>An obstacle may not be bypassed if the agent doesn't have the physical capability or it hasn't enough resources to do it. In that case, the agent tries to remove the obstacle. If it cannot do this either, the report 'Impossible work' is displayed and it waits to be reinforced (the report "wait for reinforcement" should be displayed). The next obstacle won't be reached until the agent is reinforced.</text>
