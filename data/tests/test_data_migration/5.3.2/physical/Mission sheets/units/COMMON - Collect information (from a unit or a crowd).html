<h2>Comments</h2>
</td><td>Gathering information from a unit takes time. How long it takes depends on:<br>
<ul>
<li>the affinity of the interrogated unit with regards to the agent's camp: the more the interrogated unit has affinity with the agent, the faster it acquires information (see delays in authoring tool).<br>
</li>
<li>the diplomacy matrix: an enemy cannot be interrogated if the force ratio of the agent (the interrogator) is low.<br>
