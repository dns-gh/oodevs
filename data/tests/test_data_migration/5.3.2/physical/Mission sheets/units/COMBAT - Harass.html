<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>The agent reaches a position (selected automatically by the agent) to observe the objective. The report 'zone control: started' should be displayed. The agent will therefore observe this objective to be able to engage the identified enemy elements. Any identified enemy that passes inside the objective (area or urban block) will, if possible, be destroyed. If some destroying positions are given, the agent moves between them. When the agent stops to observe the objective, the report 'zone control: stopped' should be displayed.<br>
