<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>The agent moves toward each crowd which is totally inside the specified area (the order of traversal is randomly defined).<br>Upon reaching a crowd, if it contains victims (wounded humans), the agent acts to extract victims (the report "starting to extract victims" is displayed). Once has finished (the report "victims extracted" should be displayed), a new crowd is created next to the initial crowd (with all wounded humans from initial Crowd). Note that the position of the newly created crowd is randomly determinated on the edge of the initial crowd. In consequence, the initial crowd no longer contains wounded humans.<br>The time taken for extraction does not depends on crowd size or the number of victims. Extracting victims takes a few minutes (defined in decisional models).<br>
