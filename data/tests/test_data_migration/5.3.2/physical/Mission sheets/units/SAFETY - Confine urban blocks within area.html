<h2>Context</h2>
</td><td><i>In the event of an exterior threat (a fire, for instance), populations may be prevented from leaving the buildings they occupy.</i>
<br>In SWORD, confining a urban block prevents the population from leaving or entering it. A urban block cannot be confined if it cannot be inhabited. An urban block has a "confined" status ("Yes" or "No").<br>

<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>The agent moves toward each urban block which is totally inside the specified area (the order of traversal is randomly defined). The agent stops at the border of the urban block.<br>Upon reaching a urban block, the agent confines it before moving to the next unvisited urban block.<br>

<li>the urban block is already confined (the trace "the urban block is already confined" is displayed).<br>
