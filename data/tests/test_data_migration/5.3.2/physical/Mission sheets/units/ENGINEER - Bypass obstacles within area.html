<h2>Context</h2>
</td><td><i>To reduce or negate the effects of existing or reinforcing obstacles. The objective is to maintain freedom of movement for maneuver units, weapons systems and critical supplies.</i>
<br>In Sword, to bypass a set of Sword objects retreived in a given area. Bypassing an obstacle means to make it trafficable. Agents of the simulation become able to move through a bypassed obstacle with a limited speed of movement.<br>

<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>The agent moves to the area and reconnoiters it. This stage should allow the agent to discover objects within the area. <br>
</li>
<li>Upon reconnaissance termination, the agent moves toward each obstacle to bypass (beware, all objects may not be considered as 'obstacles').  Note that order of visit is randomly determined. The position to bypass each obstacle is automatically  determinated by the agent. If an obstacle is improved with mines, the agent needs to remove mines before starting to bypass it (this makes for more delays).<br>
</li>
<li>Upon reaching an obstacle, the agent starts to bypass it (the report "work just started"  should be displayed). Upon work termination (the report "work completed for object [object name]" is displayed) the agent goes to the next obstacle.<br>
</li>
<li>An obstacle may not be bypassed if the agent doesn't have the physical capability or it hasn't enough resources to do it. In that case, the agent tries to remove the obstacle. If it cannot do this either, the report 'Impossible work' is displayed and it waits to be reinforced (the report "wait for reinforcement" should be displayed). The next obstacle won't be reached until the agent is reinforced.<br>
</li>
<li>If needed, the agent dismounts to bypass (or remove) the obstacle.<br>
</li>
<li>When all obstacles have been bypassed (or removed), the agent moves to the center of the area and the missions ends.<br>
</li>
</ul>

<td width="200">
<h2>Specific cases</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>Note that the bypassing delay can be very long (it can depend on the type and  shape of the obstacle). <br>
</li>
<li>If the "wait for reinforcement" parameter is set to "true" (default vlaue is 'FALSE') the agent waits for reinforcement before visiting the next obstacle to bypass.<br>
</li>
<li>At any times, the user can order the agent to visit the next obstacle by issuing the <b>"Go to next objective</b>" fragmentary order . If this order is issued when the agent is working on the last obstacle, the agent moves to the meeting position and the mission terminates.<br>
