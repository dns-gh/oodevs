<h2>Context</h2>
</td><td>"The technique of clearing mines using either mechanical sweeping to remove, disturb, or otherwise neutralize the mine; explosive sweeping to cause sympathetic detonations, damage, or displace the mine; or influence sweeping to produce either the acoustic or magnetic influence required to detonate the mine."<br>In sword, removing mines improvement is to make the "mining" attribute of object goes from 100% to 0%. By loosing mines improvement, an obstacle looses its attrition power in case a unit collides with it.<br>
