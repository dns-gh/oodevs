<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>The agent chooses and moves toward a supporting position to get ready to provide fire to supported units. If the chosen position is not reachable (an urban block inside which the agent cannot move, for instance), the agent moves as close as possible, else it moves to the center of the position. Average speed depends on the physical capabilities while taking into accout terrain properties.<br>
</li>
<li>The chosen position can change dynamically if the supported agents moves. In that case, the agent moves from one position to another.<br>
</li>
<li>Upon reaching a supporting position, the agent fires at enemies that engage supported friends.<br>
