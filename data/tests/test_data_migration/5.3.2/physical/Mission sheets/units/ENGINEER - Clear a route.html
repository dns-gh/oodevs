<h2>Context</h2>
</td><td><i>To reduce or negate the effects of existing or reinforcing obstacles. The objective is to maintain freedom of movement for maneuver units, weapons systems and critical supplies.</i>
<br>In Sword, to move along a computed path and remove obstacles that obstruct the path. Here, 'obstacles' are Sword 'objects' that have the capacity "avoidable" and/or "constructor".<br>

<ul>
<li>The agent moves along the computed path. If a non-bypassed 'obstacle' obstructs the path, the agent tries to reaches it.<br>
</li>
<li>Upon reaching an obstacle, the tries to remove the obstacle. Before removing the obstacle, if it is improved with mines, the agent tries to remove the improvement. If it fails (the agent has not the capacity to do it), the report "the agent cannot remove mines from the object" should be displayed. If the agent has the capacity, it starts to remove mines from it (the report "demining the object [object name]" should be displayed). Then, two possibilities:<br>
</li>
<ul>
<li>the obstacle can be removed: the agent starts to remove it (the report "work just started"  should be displayed).<br>
</li>
<li>the obstacle cannot be removed (if the agent doesn't have the physical capability or it hasn't enough resources), the report 'Impossible work' is displayed. In this case the agent waits for reinforcement. <br>
</li>
</ul>
<li>Upon work termination (the report "work completed for object [object name]" is displayed) and the agent continues to move along the path.<br>
</li>
<li>If required, the agent dismounts to perform the work.<br>
