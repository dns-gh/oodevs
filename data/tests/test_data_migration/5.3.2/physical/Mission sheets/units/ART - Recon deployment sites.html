<br>In SWORD, to know how to reconnoiter positions and build a set of planned objects that may be used by ARTY firing units to get deployed. Thus, it is usually a mission preliminary to the artillery "deploy" mission.<br>

<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>The agent moves toward each position to construct. The order of visit is user defined. The positions reached to build each position are automatically determined by the agent.<br>Upon reaching a position, the agent starts to reconnoiter it (it takes time) and then starts to construct the object position  (the "work just started" report should be displayed). <br>Upon construction termination (the report "work completed for object[object name]" should be displayed), the agent moves to the next position.<br>

<h2>Specific cases</h2>
</td><td>Work may not be completed if the agent doesn't have the physical capability or lacks resources. In that case, the report 'work impossible, no capacity' is displayed, and the agent moves to the next position.<br>If needed, the agent dismounts to construct an position.<br>
