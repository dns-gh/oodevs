<br>To provide continuous view, and the potential for reports on the activity of an objective.<i></i>
<br>In this mission, to observe an objective (a point, urban block, an area etc.) with visual means. The agent simply orientates its sensors toward an objective from a suitable position.<br>

<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>The agent chooses and moves toward the best position to observe the objective. The choice of the position depends on the agent capacity to get the best observation from each position. It is usually the nearest position to the objective with a good line of sight.  If one of the positions is not reachable (an urban block inside which the agent cannot move, for instance), the agent moves as close as possible, otherwise it moves to the center of the position. Average speed depends on the physical capabilities taking into account terrain properties.<br>
</li>
<li>Upon reaching the chosen position, the agent starts to observe the objective (the report "Position reconnaissance started" should be displayed).<br>
