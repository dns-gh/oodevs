<ul>
<li>the agent doesn't have the physical capability (no suitable launcher with regard to dotation type): the report "No launcher with capacity to use specified munition" is displayed.<br>
</li>
<li>the agent does not have enough dotation: the report "no more shells" is displayed.<br>
</li>
<li>the selected resource type cannot allow the agent to perform indirect fire: the report "Impossible indirect fire" is displayed.<br>
