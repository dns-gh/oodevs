<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>The agent protects itself with NBC protection and then moves toward the site.  If it is not reachable (it is located on a urban block inside which the agent cannot move, for instance), the agent moves as close as possible, otherwise it moves to the center of the position. Average speed depends on the physical capabilities with regards to terrain properties. <br>
</li>
<li>Upon reaching the site, the agent starts the reconnaissance (the report "reconnaissance started [object name]" should be displayed). After a period of time depending on the size of the objective, the reconnaissance ends (the report "reconnaissance completed" should be displayed), and the mission terminates.<br>
