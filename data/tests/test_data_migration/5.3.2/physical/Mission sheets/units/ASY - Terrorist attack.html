<h2>Context</h2>
</td><td><i>A surprise attack involving the deliberate use of violence against civilians in the hope of attaining political or religious aims. </i>
<br>In this Sword mission, the agent moves to the target objective and engages it with indirect fire to simulate a terrorist attack. The agent moves to the target until it reaches its position, launches the projectile onto its own position and dies.<br>

<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>The agent moves toward the objective. If it is not reachable (an urban block inside which the agent cannot move for instance), the agent moves as close as possible, else it moves to the center of the objective. Average speed depends on the physical capabilities with respect to terrain properties.<br>
</li>
<li>Upon reaching the target, the agent starts to activate its bomb (the report "attack is being executed" is displayed). Because the  bomb is simulated with an indirect fire, the explosion can be delayed regarding the bomb activation. This delay depends on the reload time of the weapon system used (see authoring tool, weapon system tab). Because the explosion results from indirect fire, the reports "under artillery fire" and "friendly indirect fire" should be displayed too.<br>
</li>
<li>Upon bomb activation, all units around should be affected by the bomb, and the agent dies. This terminates the mission.<br>
</li>
<li>The attack may failed if the given dotation type (the bomb to activate) cannot be used with a short distance target. In that case the report "Attentat impossible" is displayed.<br>
</li>
<li>If this mission is carried out by a "terrorist" agent, it may not be possible to detect it unless the target unit is defended by safety devices such as check points.<br>
