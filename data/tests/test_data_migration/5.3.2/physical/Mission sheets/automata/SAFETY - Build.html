</li>
<ul>
<li>If there are strictly more works to perform than capable units, all the units will be provided one obstacle. As soon as a unit has finished to build an obstacle, another obstacle will be assigned to him, unless there is no more obstacle left to build, in which case he will receive a *Move to* order to the rally point, or will help with other works if he can.<br>
