<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>The commander agent issues the "Transport" mission to subordinate units (the number of subordinate to perform the transportation mission depends on the number of units to transport and the number of subordinates able to perform the 'Transport' mission). Normally, the commander agent uses the same number of subordinates as there are units to transport.<br>
</li>
<li>If the "Synchronized transport" parameter is set to "Wait for other subordinates", every subordinate will wait for all the other transporting subordinates before leaving the embarking/disembarking position, so that they all leave together.<br>
</li>
<li>Subordinate units that cannot perform the transportation (due to incompatible physical capability) move directly to the meeting position.<br>
</li>

<td width="200">
<h2>Comments</h2>
</td><td>Units to transport need to perform the "Get transported" mission. <br>They also need to be <u>located inside the "embarkation area"</u>. If not, the subordirnates agents waits for specified units to be located into the 'embarkation area' and then the transportation begins.<br>
