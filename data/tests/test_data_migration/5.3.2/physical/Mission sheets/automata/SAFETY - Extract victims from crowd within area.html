<li>If there are crowds with victims to extract in the area at the beginning of the mission, then the commander agent issues a *Extract victims from crowds* order to each capable agent (the others will not receive any order). Every one of them is given a single crowd to extract victims from, and whenever a subordinate has finished its task, another crowd will be provided to him, for as long as there are still crowds to process. When there are no longer such crowds, the units will wait for further orders.<br>
