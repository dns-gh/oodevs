    <line>
      <text>In SWORD, extinguishing a fire can avoid alerting or evacuating populations from urban blocks. Only occasional fires are used to render the effect of arsons and local fires, to stimulate the intervention of firefighters. They cannot propagate, but can be extinguished by specific units. When an occasional fire is extinguished, it disappears.</text>
    </line>
    <line>
      <text>A fire decreases depending on the decrease rate. When a fire reaches the '0' value, it is extinguished. Extinguishing a fire with specific units applies additional decrease rates on a fire.</text>
