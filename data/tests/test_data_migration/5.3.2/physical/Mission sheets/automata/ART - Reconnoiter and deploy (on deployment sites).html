<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>The commander agent issues the "ReconnoiterDeploymentSites" mission to the reconnaissance platoons, with the set of positions as parameter. Upon reconnaissance termination the 'position' objects are created. Each positions are fairly shared between reconnaissance platoons.<br>
</li>
<li>Other units are ordered to reach the meeting position.<br>
</li>
<li>A position may not be built if the subordinate reconnaissance platoon doesn't have the physical capability or it hasn't enough resources to do it. In that case, the unit goes to next position.<br>
</li>
<li>When all positions have been reconnoitered and built, the reconnaissance units move to the meeting position and the commander waits the order "continue mission" to be issued by user (the report "waiting order deploy firing units" is displayed).<br>
</li>
<li>Once the fragmentary order is issued, the commander order firing subordinate units to deploy onto created 'position' objects. One units for one position.<br>
</li>
<li>Other units are ordered to reach the meeting position.<br>
