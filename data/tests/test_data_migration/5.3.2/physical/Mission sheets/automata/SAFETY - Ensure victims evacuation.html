<ul>
<li>The commander agent issues a "Ensure victims evacuation" order to each capable agent. Every one of them is given a single unit to evacuate (the closest one to them), and whenever a subordinate has finished to evacuate a unit, another unit to evacuate is given to him, for as long as there are units left to evacuate. When there are no longer such units, the subordinates are given a *Move To* order to the rally point instead.<br>
