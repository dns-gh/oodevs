<ul>
<li>The commander agent issues the "Construct" mission to the engineer platoons, with a set of works as parameter. Works are fairly shared between engineer platoons.<br>
</li>
<li>Other units are ordered to reach the meeting position (if the number of engineer platoons is greater than the number of obstacles, non used platoons are ordered to reach the meeting position).<br>
</li>
<li>When all works have been completed, the engineer units move to the meeting position and the mission ends.<br>

<h2>Specific cases</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>A work may not be built if one of the subordinate units doesn't have the physical capability or it hasn't enough resources to do it. In that case, two possibilities:<br>
</li>
<ul>
<li>the mission parameter "Wait for reinforcement" is set to TRUE : a subordinate unit receive the "Contruct" mission with the object as parameter and wait to be reinforced (the company should be reinforced with adapted device),<br>
</li>
<li>the mission parameter "Wait for reinforcement" is set to FALSE (default value): the object is ignored.<br>
