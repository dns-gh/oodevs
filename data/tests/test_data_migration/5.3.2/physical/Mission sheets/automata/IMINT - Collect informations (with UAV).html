<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>The commander agent issues the "Collect informations (with UAV)" mission to the drone station. The drone station self-deploys on the deployment position (its position by default) and operates one or more (depends of the number of routes) of its transported UAV agent (the UAV should emit the "UAV ready" report to notify that it has just been operated).<br>
</li>
<li>Upon deployment termination, operted UAV units are automatically launched and follow each given route. Then, it returns back to the drone station and it is automatically loaded.<br>
</li>
<li>If the user give more routes than drones, some drones will fly twice in order to collect information in all routes.<br>
