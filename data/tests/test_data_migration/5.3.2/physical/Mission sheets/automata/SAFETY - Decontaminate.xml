      <text>In SWORD, decontaminating a site ("contaminated site") prevents units from being contaminated. It prevents the creation and the dispersion of a contaminated cloud that can cause injuries in units. A "decontaminated site" in SWORD is defined by a surface delimited by a polygon. All contamination objects (such as "contaminated area") that intersect with the decontaminated surface lose their contamination capacity.</text>

            <text>If there are strictly more sites to decontaminate than capable units, all the units will be provided one site to decontaminate. As soon as a unit has finished to decontaminate an area, another site will be assigned to him, unless there is no more sites left to decontaminate, in which case he will receive a *Move to* order to the rally point.</text>

            <text>Otherwise, the sites will all be provided to the units at the beginning of the mission. They will be fairly distributed among them, and if they are any area (polygon) to decontaminate, it may be split so that multiple units can work on them. Only one unit can work on a urban block at the same time, therefore if there are only urban blocks to decontaminate and no areas, there may be units with no sites to decontaminate, in which case the leftover units will receive a *Move To* order to the rally point instead.</text>
