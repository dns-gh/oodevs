<h2>Specific cases</h2>
</td><td>If there are no engineer units, the teeth arm platoons will build the obstacles to be erected. Otherwise, only the engineer units will build the obstacles - unless some obstacles can not be built by the engineers, in which case the teeth arm platoons will try to build the remaining obstacles. In any case, the entities to build will be assigned equitably to the units.<br>
