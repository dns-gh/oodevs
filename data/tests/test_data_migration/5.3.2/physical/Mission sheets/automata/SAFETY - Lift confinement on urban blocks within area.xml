      <text>In SWORD, lifting confinement on an urban block allows the population to leave or enter it. This mission is the reverse of the "Confiine urban blocks within area" mission. Its goal is to lift confinement of a set of urban blocks within a specified zone.</text>

    <ul>

        <line>
          <text>The commander agent issues a "Lift confinement on urban blocks" order to each capable agent. Every one of them is given a single urban block to lift confinement on (the closest one to them), and whenever a subordinate has finished to lift confinement on a urban block, another urban block to lift confinement on is given to him, for as long as there are urban blocks left to lift confinement on. When there are no longer such urban blocks, the subordinates are given a *Move To" order to the rally point instead (if there is no rally point, then the subordinates remain at their current position).</text>

  <specific-cases>
    <line>
      <text>The confinement may not be lifted on the urban block if it cannot be populated (the report "no population in the urban block" is displayed). In that specific case, the agent in charge of this urban block will pursue his mission with his other assigned urban blocks, and the commander mission continues.</text>
