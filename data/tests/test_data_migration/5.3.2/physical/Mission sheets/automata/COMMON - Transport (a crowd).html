<h2>Context</h2>
</td><td><i>To provide general transport service in the movement of personnel and cargo.</i>
<br>In SWORD, transporting crowds allows to move them to a given location with appropriate means. Because the agent can only transports crowds' concentrations, this mission needs a loading position to indicate which concentration to transport. Indeed, a crowd can be compouded with several separated concentrations and only one concentration can be transported at a time. The agent will transport the nearest concentration from the "loadingPoint" parameter.<br>
