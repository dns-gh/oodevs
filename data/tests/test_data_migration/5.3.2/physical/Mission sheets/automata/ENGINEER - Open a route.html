<h2>Context</h2>
</td><td><i>To reduce or negate the effects of existing or reinforcing obstacles. The objectives are to maintain freedom of movement for maneuver units, weapons systems and critical supplies.</i>
<br>In Sword, to move along a computed path and bypass obstacles that collide with the path. Here, 'obstacles' are sword 'objects' that have the capacity "avoidable" and/or "constuctor".<br>

<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>The commander agent issues the "Open a route" mission to the engineer platoons, with a set of waypoints as parameter.<br>
</li>
<li>Because few subordinate agents can perform the same works, opening a route with a engineer company can be very efficient (in term of delays).<br>
</li>
<li>When the last waypoints have been reached, the mission terminates.<br>
