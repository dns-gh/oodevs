      <text>In SWORD, a population is evacuated from the urban block it populates. This mission is the reverse of the "Lift evacuation from urban blocks within area" mission. Its goal is to lift an evacuation on a set of urban blocks within a specified zone.</text>

        <line>
          <text>The commander agent issues a "Lift evacuation on urban blocks" order to each capable agent. Every one of them is given a single urban block to lift evacuation on (the closest one to them), and whenever a subordinate has finished to lift evacuation on a urban block, another urban block to lift evacuation on is given to him, for as long as there are urban blocks left to lift evacuation on. When there are no longer such urban blocks, the subordinates are given a *Move To" order to the rally point instead (if there is no rally point, then the subordinates remain at their current position).</text>

  <specific-cases>
    <line>
      <text>The evacuation status may not be lifted if the urban block cannot be populated (the report "urban block cannot be inhabited" is displayed) . In that specific case, the agent in charge of this urban block will pursue his mission with his other assigned urban blocks, and the commander mission continues.</text>
