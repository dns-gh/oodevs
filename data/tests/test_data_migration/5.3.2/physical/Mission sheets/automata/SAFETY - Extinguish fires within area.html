<h2>Context</h2>
</td><td><i>To fix, control and extinguish a fire that threatens populations or structures.</i>
<br>In SWORD, extinguishing a fire can avoid alerting or evacuating populations from urban blocks. Only occasional fires are used to render the effect of arsons and local fires, to stimulate the intervention of firefighters. They cannot propagate, but can be extinguished by specific units. When an occasional fire is extinguished, it disappears.<br>A fire decreases depending on the decrease rate. When a fire reaches the '0' value, it is extinguished. Extinguishing a fire with specific units applies additional decrease rates on a fire.<br>

<ul>
<li>The commander agent issues a "Extinguish a fire" mission to each capable agent. There are two cases :<br>
</li>
<ul>
<li>if there are strictly more fires to extinguish than capable units, all the units will be provided one fire to extinguish. As soon as a unit has finished to extinguish a fire, another fire will be assigned to him, unless there is no more fire left to extinguish, in which case he will receive a *Move to* order to the garage position;<br>
</li>
<li>  Number of fires to extinguish is smaller than capable units: fires will be fairly distributed among capable subordinate units. Several units can extinguish a fire at the same time.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<li>The other units (non capable units) are given a "Move To" order to the garage position.<br>
