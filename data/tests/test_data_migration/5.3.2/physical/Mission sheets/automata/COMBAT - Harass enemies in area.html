<ul>
<li>First case: positions are issued.<br>
</li>
<ul>
<li>The commander agent issues the "Harass enemies in area" mission to the armor platoons, with the area and positions as parameters. Positions are fairly shared between platoons.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<li>Second case: no position issued.<br>
</li>
<ul>
<li>The commander agent computes sub-area into the provided area and issues the "Harass enemies in area" mission to the armor platoons, with a sub-area as parameters (one sub area per subordinate unit).<br>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Rear echelon units:<br>

<li>Other units (reserve and non adapted units) receive the "moveTo" mission with the with the meeting position as parameter.<br>

<li>Units able to perform indirect fires (such as mortar troops) receive the "Provide indirect fires (dynamic)" mission with harassing units as parameter.<br>

<ul>
<li>If no position issued, the subordinate units tries to retreive key positions inside the area. Key positions are defined by:<br>
</li>
<ul>
<li>crossroads<br>
</li>
<li>roads intersections with the company area<br>
</li>
<li>urban blocks.<br>
</li>

</ul>Beware before issuing this mission to choose carefully the area. If area is located in open terrain without many roads inside, the mission won't be performed in a good way if user don't designate the positions.<br>
