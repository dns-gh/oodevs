          <text>The commander agent issues a "Lift alert on urban blocks" order to each capable agent. Every one of them is given a single urban block to lift alert on (the closest one to them), and whenever a subordinate has finished to lift alert on a urban block, another urban block to lift alert on is given to him, for as long as there are urban blocks left to lift alert on. When there are no longer such urban blocks, the subordinates are given a *Move To" order to the rally point instead (if there is no rally point, then the subordinates remain at their current position).</text>
