<h2>Context</h2>

<br>In SWORD, to order subordinate units to  build a set of planned objects that may be used by ARTY firing units to get deployed. Thus, it is usually a mission preliminary to the artilery "deploy" mission.<br>

<h2>Behavior</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>The commander agent issues the "ReconnoiterDeploymentSites" mission to the reconnaissance platoons, with a set of positions as parameter. Upon reconnaissance termination the 'position' objects are created (creation can take delay). Each positions are fairly shared between reconnaissance platoons.<br>
</li>
<li>Other units are ordered to follow.<br>
</li>
<li>A position may not be built if the subordinate reconnaissance platoon doesn't have the physical capability or it hasn't enough resources to do it. In that case, the unit goes to next position.<br>
</li>
<li>When all positions have been reconnoitered and built, the reconnaissance units move to the meeting position and the mission terminates.<br>
