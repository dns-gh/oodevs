        <text>Alerting is to inform inhabitants about an impending danger, allowing the population to shelter from it. The final goal is to minimize the number of victims and minimize subsequent evacuation time.</text>

      <text>In SWORD, a population is alerted via the urban block it populates. An urban block cannot be alerted if it is not populated. An urban block has an "alerted" status (it is either "alerted" or "not alerted"). After being "alerted", the population may be "evacuated" faster.</text>

          <text>The commander agent issues a "Alert urban blocks" order to each capable agent. Every one of them is given a single urban block to alert (the closest one to them), and whenever a subordinate has finished to alert a urban block, another urban block to alert is given to him, for as long as there are urban blocks left to alert. When there are no longer such urban blocks, the subordinates are given a *Move To" order to the rally point instead (if there is no rally point, then the subordinates remain at their current position).</text>
