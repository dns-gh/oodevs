<li>The commander agent issues a "Heal victims within crowds" order to each capable agent. Every one of them is given a single crowd to heal victims from (the closest one to them), and whenever a subordinate has finished to process a crowd, another crowd is given to him, for as long as there are crowds left to process. When there are no longer such crowds, the subordinates are given a *Move To" order to the rally point instead.<br>
