<h2>Context</h2>
</td><td><i>The purpose of any river crossing is to project combat power across a water obstacle to accomplish a mission. The challenge is to minimize the river's impact on the commander's ability to maneuver.</i>
<br>In Sword, to use given crossing sites object to construct a set of "bridge" objects in order to allow friend units to cross a water obstacle.<br>

<h2>Behavior</h2>

<ul>
<li>First stage: crossing sites reconnaissance.<br>
</li>
<ul>
<li>The commander agent issues the "Reconnoiter a crossing site" mission to the engineer platoons, with a crossing site as parameter (one platoon per crossing site to reconnoiter).<br>
</li>
<li>Other units are ordered to follow.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<li>Second stage :  the commander agent issues the "Bridge" mission to the engineer platoons, with a crossing site as parameter (one platoon per crossing site to bridge),<br>
</li>
<ul>
<li>Other units stays on the meeting position.<br>
</li>
<li>Once the "bridge" objects are constructed, friends units should be able to cross the water obstacle.<br>

<h2>Comments</h2>
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>For the commander agent, to order subordinates units to bridge in order to make friend units cross a water obstacle. The mission execution defines two stages: first one is the reconnaissance of the crossing sites, the second one is the bridging of the crossing sites.<br>
</li>
<li>Note that only engineer units work for that mission. Other units reach the meeting position.<br>
