      <text>In Sword, a "safety" attitude is issued in order to prepare the agent to enemy contact. In that case the agent dismounts and increases its perception capabilities (flank and rear observation are better), but it moves slower. A "standard" attitude is issued when speed is desired and contact with the enemy is considered to be unlikely.</text>
