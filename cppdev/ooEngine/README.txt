# Usage
- add a folder next to the ooEngine.sln file named externallibs
It should contains the SDL2 lib under the folder named SDL2-2.0.3
(see https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php and choose a *devel-2.0.3-VC* lib)
The path to the lib should look like that : dev\ooEngine\externallibs\SDL2-2.0.3
- add the SDL2.dll to the folder containing the exe for execution
# Info
Early dev is actually available under x64 platform only (Debug or release mode)
